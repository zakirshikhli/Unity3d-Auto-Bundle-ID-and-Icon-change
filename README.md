# Unity3d-Auto-Bundle-ID-and-Icon-change

This is a sample script for auto modifing app **bundle id** and **icons** while typing app name
* **Just put this script to _Editor_ folder and customise pathes and bundle names**
* To create separate icons for different resolution use https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html


P.S. I could not find how to change only single "default icon" via script :(
